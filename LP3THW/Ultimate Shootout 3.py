# Author: Nick Ephraims

# We have a penalty spot kick. The player selects from 3 options and the goalkeeper selects randomly.
# If there is a match the shot is saved otherwise a goal is scored

# Function for penalty shot randomizer / score keeper
# second function for goal keeper AI shot randomizer
# seperate functions for goal scored, goal missed, goal saved, goal conceded. 
# invalid response slipped voer and booted ball into the stands
# if x shots remaining and score difference is + or - certain amount then exit
